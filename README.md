# Promotion-Code-Checker
This code specifies using the api endpoint to check if the "promotion" code provided by discord is valid or not.

# Info 

You need to have email verified discord tokens to use this code.
Proceed with putting 1 token in "token" format in every line of data/tokens.txt (The more you put the better)
This is a way to bypass discord rate limits by providing a token in authorization header.
You then need to put all ur promo codes in input/codes.txt and run the code.
